Semantic Versioning implementation in Swift!
Use the struct `SemanticVersion` to represents a version according to the [Semantic Versioning Specification 2.0.0](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). 


Fully Unit tested

100% Swift
 

##Getting Started

### Requirements

- iOS 7.0+ / Mac OS X 10.9+
- Xcode 6.3+
- Swift 1.2

###Installation
The easiest way to use SemanticVersion in your project is using the CocaPods package manager.


###CocoaPods
See installation instructions for [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) if not already installed

CocoaPods 0.36 beta adds supports for Swift and embedded frameworks. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods --pre
```

To integrate the library into your Xcode project specify the pod dependency to your `Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '8.0'

pod 'SemanticVersioning'
```

run pod install

```bash
pod install
```

### Source File

For application targets that do not support embedded frameworks, such as iOS 7, You can add all *.swift source files directly into your project. 

You can add a git submodule and drag and drop the sources into the project navigator.

##Usage

Create version 2.0.0

```Swift 
let version = SemanticVersion(major: 2)
```

Create version 1.2.3

```Swift 
let version = SemanticVersion(major: 1, minor: 2, patch: 3) 
```

Create version 1.0.0-alpha.2

```Swift
let version = SemanticVersion(major: 1, preReleaseIdentifier: ["alpha", "2"])
```

Create version from a String

```Swift
let version: SemanticVersion = "1.3.10-rc"
```

Create a list of versions from a Array of Strings

```Swift
let versions: [SemanticVersion] = ["1.0.0-alpha", "1.0.0-alpha.1"] 
```

Check if is prerelease version or not

```Swift
if version.isPrerelease { ... } 
```

Access the prerelease identifier via the preReleaseIdentifier Array

```Swift
for identifier in version.preReleaseIdentifier
{
    // ...
}
```

Access the build metadata identifier via the buildMetadataIdentifier Array

```Swift
for identifier in version.buildMetadataIdentifier
{
    // ...
} 
```

Conforms to Printable so you can simply get a String representation by accessing the description property

```Swift
println(version)
// OR
let stringRepresentation = version.description
```

mutability / immutability


### Comparsion

The default operators for comparsion are implemented
`<` , `<=` , `>` ,`>=` ,`==` , `!=`
This will comapre major, minor, patch and the prerelease identifiers according to the [Semantic Versioning Sepcification 2.0.0](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)


Additionally there are experimental operators `â‰ˆ` and `!â‰ˆ`

They will only comapre the major, minor and patch version but not the prerelease identifiers.


##Parser

The implementation includes a full-fledged component ot parse String representation of a version. Please have a look at the tests and the soruce of `SemanticVersionParser` for now ðŸ˜‰

##Tests

The libary includes a suite of tests showing how to use the different initialiser and the Parser
